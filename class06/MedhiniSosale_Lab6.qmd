Question 1:
```{r}
student_hw <- read.csv('student_homework.csv')

grade <- function(student){
  sorted <- sort(student)
  student_new <- sorted[-1]
  return(student_new)
}

grade <- function(){
  # if there is an NA, remove NA
  # if not, remove the lowest numerical value
  # take the average of the values that are left to determine overall grade
  # return overall grade for each student, labeled
}

sapply(student_grades, grade)
# note that apply runs on tables
```
